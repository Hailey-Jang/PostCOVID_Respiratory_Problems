# Wellbeing-Youth
## Overview 

this repo explores crisis services and support programs for youth facing substance use and addiction issues, focusing on the relationship between legal status and program effectiveness. Utilizing a taxonomy-based search of 211 Toronto's database, we simulated a dataset using a comprehensive R script. 

## File Structure

The repo is structured as: 

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
