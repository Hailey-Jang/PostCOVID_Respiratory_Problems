# Results 
## Rhinovirus
In delving deeper into the landscape of respiratory outbreaks in Toronto healthcare institutions, a crucial aspect of our analysis involves identifying the specific viruses that contribute most significantly to these incidents. Understanding the predominant viral agents responsible for respiratory infections is pivotal for targeted preventive measures, effective treatment strategies, and informed public health interventions. In this exploration, we aim to unravel the intricate network of viral contributors, shedding light on the specific viruses that exert a substantial impact on the respiratory health dynamics within these healthcare settings. By discerning the key viral players, we can glean insights that will not only enhance our comprehension of the current state but also inform future strategies for mitigating the prevalence and consequences of respiratory outbreaks.

The graphical representation, @fig-3, comparing the rates of causative agents for respiratory outbreaks in Toronto healthcare institutions in 2020 and 2023 provides insightful observations. Notably, the data underscores a significant shift in the prominence of Rhinovirus as a causative agent between the two years. In 2023, Rhinovirus emerges as the predominant viral contributor, reporting a notably higher incidence compared to its occurrence in 2020.

Specifically, in 2023, Rhinovirus stands out as the most frequently reported causative agent for respiratory outbreaks, with 77 documented cases. This substantial increase is particularly noteworthy when contrasted with its presence in 2020, where Rhinovirus was reported merely seven times. The surge in Rhinovirus cases in 2023 positions it at the forefront, signifying a noteworthy change in the landscape of respiratory infections during this period.

Comparatively, in 2020, Respiratory syncytial virus took precedence as the leading causative agent, reporting 19 cases, followed closely by Influenza A with 18 cases. However, the dynamic shift in 2023, with Rhinovirus surpassing these previously dominant agents, suggests an evolving pattern in the prevalence of respiratory viruses. The observed rise in Rhinovirus cases may be indicative of changing epidemiological factors, altered patient demographics, or other environmental influences that warrant further investigation.

# Discussion
## Rhinovirus in 2023
The resurgence of Rhinovirus (RV) in 2023, particularly in comparison to other respiratory viruses following the relaxation of social distancing measures, demands a detailed examination. At the forefront of this resurgence is the unique protein capsid of Rhinovirus, endowing it with heightened resistance to ethanol-containing disinfectants—an attribute not shared by viruses with lipid envelopes.The efficacy of facemasks in filtering out Rhinovirus is notably compromised due to its smaller size compared to influenza virus and coronavirus, potentially contributing to the observed resurgence. The implementation of social-distancing measures, restrictions on social gatherings, and intensified hygiene protocols in response to the March 2020 COVID-19 outbreak significantly curtailed exposure opportunities to Rhinovirus and other infectious agents. This led to a substantial reduction in both respiratory viral infections and healthcare utilization for asthma. However, the intricacies of this dynamic become apparent with the specific resurgence of Rhinovirus infections following the fall 2020 reopening of schools. Unlike other respiratory viruses that remained subdued, Rhinovirus exhibited a significant uptick in prevalence.

The discernible influence of social interventions on Rhinovirus underscores the significance of its intrinsic attributes, particularly its diminutive size and capsid coat. According to Kreger (@Kreger), these characteristics may contribute to its reduced susceptibility to masking agents and disinfectants. The observed incremental surge in asthma-related hospitalizations subsequent to the reopening of schools implies a complex interconnection between Rhinovirus infections and exacerbations of asthma. Significantly, notwithstanding the increase in admissions, the levels remained below those observed prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing a nuanced interplay among respiratory infections, societal dynamics, and health outcomes associated with asthma.

\newpage

# Conclusion
The resurgence of Rhinovirus post-social distancing measures unveils a complex interplay of factors, highlighting the unique characteristics of Rhinovirus, the absence of influenza infections, and the dynamics of viral interference. The differential impact of social measures on various respiratory viruses underscores the necessity for tailored public health strategies. The observed partial increase in asthma hospitalizations following school reopening emphasizes the intricate relationship between respiratory infections and asthma outcomes.

Moving forward, a nuanced understanding of these dynamics is essential for mitigating the impact of respiratory infections and optimizing public health interventions in the post-COVID era. This exploration not only contributes to our comprehension of Rhinovirus resurgence but also underscores the need for adaptive strategies in the ongoing battle against respiratory infections in healthcare settings.
